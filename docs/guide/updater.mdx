## About

DreamTime by itself is only a user interface that allows you to use nudification technology easily, however the nudification process is carried out with external applications that we call components.

The updater allows you to download, install and keep updated this [components](/docs/guide/components).

## Use

The process is very simple, you just need to press the `Update` button to start downloading the update file from an available server. Once the download has finished the updater will start to install the file automatically and if necessary, restart DreamTime.

:::info
Files downloaded by the updater will be saved in the `Downloads` folder of your operating system. If you have already downloaded the file, the updater will ask you if you want to use it or download it again.
