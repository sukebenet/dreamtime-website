title: Custom masks

![](/img/previews/screely-1595746060740.png)

Custom masks or "Advanced mode" is a special mode in DreamTime that allows you to work with the masks generated by the algorithms to achieve results that DreamPower alone is not capable of. 

On this page we will talk about how it works and how to work efficiently in this mode.

## How it works

DreamPower consists of several algorithms inside, each one of them is in charge of creating a mask that together give the resulting fake nude. 

In this mode we give you the opportunity to advance mask by mask in the process, make modifications to them and generate a better fake nude.

## Tips

These are tips that can help you work with customs masks.

### Open the masks folder

<video src="/img/masks/videos/folder.mp4" autoplay muted loop controls></video>

In the upper right side of the application you will find the `Masks` button, when you click it you will open in the file explorer the folder where the generated masks will be stored.

Keep this folder open while you work on the photo.

### You can replace the masks

<video src="/img/masks/videos/upload.mp4" autoplay muted loop controls></video>

At any time you can replace a specific mask in two ways:

1. Drag and drop the photo onto the mask box.
2. Click the `Upload` button to select the photo.

Please note that this is only necessary if you want to replace the mask with another photo or if you want to resume a past project. DreamTime automatically detects external changes to the photos:

### Realtime changes

<video src="/img/masks/videos/realtime.mp4" autoplay muted loop controls></video>

All the changes you make externally to the masks will be applied automatically in DreamTime. This avoids having to manually upload each change you make.

Try it! Open a photo with an external photo editor (Paint, Photoshop, GIMP), make changes and you will see them in DreamTime automatically.

## Masks

### Corrected

![](/img/masks/DressToCorrect.png)

**Filename:** `DressToCorrect.png`

In this mask the OpenCV algorithm applies a color correction to better understand the photo.

Using the `Color Padding` scale method it is possible to drastically minimize the effect of this mask with the consequence of obtaining worse results in some photos.

This mask cannot be edited because it is automatically generated and there is no need to modify it.

### Maskcloth

![](/img/masks/CorrectToMask.png)

**Filename:** `CorrectToMask.png`

In this mask the pix2pix algorithm identifies the person's clothing and labels it with green color.

It is very possible that visual artifacts are generated, so the modification of this mask is not recommended.

### Maskref

![](/img/masks/MaskToMaskref.png)

**Filename:** `MaskToMaskref.png`

In this mask the OpenCV algorithm corrects the problems that have been generated in `Maskcloth` using `Corrected` as reference.

This is where we recommend starting to identify problems and correct them.

**Problems:**

Use the photo above as an example of a good `Maskref`.

- Objects other than clothing.
- Several people's clothing.
- Not all of the person's clothing.

**Colors:**

| Name  | Color | Hexadecimal |
| ----- | ----- | ----------- |
| Cloth | Green | #00CD00     |

### Maskdet

![](/img/masks/MaskrefToMaskdet.png)

**Filename:** `MaskrefToMaskdet.png`

In this mask the pix2pix algorithm identifies the parts of the body using the labeled clothing as a reference point.

This is the most important mask for most users.

**Problems:**

Use the photo above as an example of a good `Maskdet`.

- Deformed or non-areola boobs.
- Incorrect position of the boobs or nipples.
- Incorrect position of the belly button.
- Incorrect position of the vagina.

**Colors:**

| Name         | Color   | Hexadecimal |
| ------------ | ------- | ----------- |
| Boobs        | Black   | #000000     |
| Areola       | Red     | #FF0000     |
| Belly button | Magenta | #FF00FF     |
| Vagina       | Blue    | #0000FF     |

### Maskfin

![](/img/masks/MaskdetToMaskfin.png)

**Filename:** `MaskdetToMaskfin.png`

In this mask the OpenCV algorithm makes additional preparations for the last step using `Maskref` and `Maskdet` as reference. The body part size options are also applied here.

It is recommended to only make subtle modifications to this mask.

**Problems:**

None, problems should be corrected in `Maskref`.

**Colors:**

| Name       | Color     | Hexadecimal |
| ---------- | --------- | ----------- |
| Pubic hair | Dove Gray | #646464     |

### Nude

![](/img/masks/MaskfinToNude.png)

**Filename:** `MaskfinToNude.png`

Congratulations, you have reached the last mask, the fake nude! The modifications from here are all yours.

### Others

You may see additional masks in DreamTime depending on your options, these masks are created by DreamTime, it is not necessary to modify them and they do not affect the result of the algorithm.

## Tutorial: Layers

When modifying customs masks you will realize that it can be very useful to intelligently combine 2 masks when making corrections, for these cases the "Layers" function of programs like GIMP and Photoshop can help a lot.

For this small tutorial we will use [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) with [PhotoGIMP](https://github.com/Diolinux/PhotoGIMP) in this way the steps for Photoshop will be similar.

### The problem

<div align="center" className="row">
  <div className="col col--6"><img src="/img/masks/repair/DressToCorrect.png" style={{ height: 373 }} /></div>
  <div className="col col--6"><img src="/img/masks/repair/MaskToMaskref.png" style={{ height: 373 }} /></div>
</div>

In the photo above we can see that the algorithm has incorrectly generated the `Maskref` by identifying part of the woman's body and the ocean as clothing, to repair this mask we have 2 options:

- Use the `Corrected` and label the clothes manually.
- Add a `Layer Mask` to the `Maskref` and use the `Corrected` as a base to remove the excess.

In this tutorial we will use the second option.

### The repair

1. Open the `Maskref` in GIMP.

<img src="/img/masks/repair/gimp1.png" style={{ maxHeight: 373 }} /><br /><br />

2. Drag and drop `Corrected` into GIMP to add it as a Layer.

<img src="/img/masks/repair/gimp2.png" style={{ maxHeight: 373 }} /><br /><br />

3. Right click on `Maskref` and select the option `Add Layer Mask...`

<img src="/img/masks/repair/gimp3.png" style={{ maxHeight: 373 }} /><br /><br />

4. Do not change any option and click the button `Add`. This will create a white box next to the `Maskref`.

<img src="/img/masks/repair/gimp4.png" style={{ maxHeight: 373 }} /><br /><br />

5. Click on the white box, select the brush tool and the black color, when drawing on the photo you will realize how useful this can be.
