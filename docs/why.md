title: Nudification Technology
---

This technology was born with DeepNude but will not die with it. Although it has proven to be somewhat [problematic](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/kzm59x/deepnude-app-creates-fake-nudes-of-any-woman), we believe that this technology opens the doors to new forms of entertainment that we could see creatively applied in the future. 

From detailed nude generation of 3D models to fully computer generated pornography (no human actors), the possibilities open up.

This technology was going to come sooner or later so it is better to continue its development responsibly.

## The beginning

These are some examples of people/projects that have used DreamTime creatively and that we believe are the correct start of this technology:

> If you have similar projects do not hesitate to [send it to us](/docs/support/feedback), we love to see creative ways in which this technology is applied.


## DeepNude

With the [abandonment of DeepNude](https://twitter.com/deepnudeapp/status/1144307316231200768), the project was left without a central team dedicated to improving it or servers to distribute it, this caused thousands of websites to begin distributing "cracked" copies of the program, which on several occasions could be full of malware and even when downloading the real application one would quickly realize its limitations and problems due to the poor development of its interface.

**For these reasons, DreamTime and DreamPower were born.**
