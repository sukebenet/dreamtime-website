DreamTime is an application that allows you to easily create fake nudes from a photo. A user interface made from scratch that replaces DeepNude's unstable interface and uses an improved version of its [algorithm](/docs/dreampower) for better results.

DreamTime can be considered a spiritual successor to **DeepNude** since it allows you to use the same technology with improvements and advanced options.
