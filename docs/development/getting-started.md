## Requirements

- [NodeJS 10+](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

### Experience

It will be easier for you to work with the code if you have experience in:

- [HTML, CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/html-css) and [JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/javascript).
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/): CSS Preprocessor.
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): CSS Framework.
- [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) and [NuxtJS](https://nuxtjs.org/): JavaScript frameworks.
- [Electron](https://electronjs.org/): Software used to "transform" DreamTime from a website to a desktop application.

## Setup

All the source code is in the `src` folder, this instructions are based on that folder.

### Directory Structure

| Directory            | Description |
|--------------------|------------|
| `build` | Files used by [electron-builder](https://www.electron.build/). |
| `electron` | "Backend" code, must be compiled with Babel. |
| `modules` | Code and utilities out of the scope of NuxtJS. |
| `patches` | Monkey-patches |
| `scripts` | External scripts. |
| Others | [See NuxtJS Directory Structure.](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/directory-structure) |

### Dependencies

Install the project dependencies running this command:

`yarn install`


### Development enviroment

Run the following commands to start the dev environment, once prepared you will have the DreamTime window, the DevTools and hot-reload ready.

`yarn run start:nuxt`

`yarn run start:babel`

`yarn run start:electron`


:::info
If you are using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) you can run the task `Build` to open the first two commands in parallel terminals and press `F5` to run the last command and open the DreamTime window.
:::

## Scripts

These are the commands that you can run with `yarn run <command>`:

| Command            | Description |
|--------------------|------------|
| `lint` |Run [eslint](https://eslint.org/) to validate that the code complies with our syntax.|
| `start:nuxt` |Run the [NuxtJS development server](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/commands) with hot-reload.|
| `start:babel` |Compile the `electron` folder with hot-reload.|
| `start:electron` | Open Electron using the compiled code from the previous command. |
| `build` | Compile the NuxtJS code, the `electron` folder, and create a ready-to-distribute executable. |
| `clean` | Delete folders with compiled code. |
| `optimize` | Run [modclean](https://npmjs.com/package/modclean) to clean the `node_modules` folder and decrease the size of the executable. |
| `build:nuxt` | Compile the NuxtJS code. |
| `build:babel` | Compile the `electron` folder. |
| `build:electron` | Create a ready-to-distribute executable. |
| `build:dev` | Same as `build` but without running `optimize`. |
| `preview:production` | Compile the NuxtJS code, the `electron` folder and open Electron as if it were the production executable. |
| `postinstall` | It is executed automatically when running `yarn install`, for now it is responsible for running [patch-package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/patch-package) to apply monkey-patches to some libraries. |
| `test` | Should run a series of tests to verify that the project works as it should, but these tests have not been created. ðŸ¤¡ |
| `deploy` | Run [@dreamnet/deploy](https://npm.dreamnet.tech/-/web/detail/@dreamnet/deploy) to upload the ready-to-distribute executable to multiple file providers. |
