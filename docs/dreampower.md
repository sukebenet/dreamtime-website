DreamPower is a fork of the [DeepNude algorithm](https://github.com/stacklikemind/deepnude_official) that generates better fake nudes and puts at your disposal a command line interface.

**DreamPower is free and open-source.**

### Multiplatform

Available for **Windows, Linux and Mac**. 

You can download the smaller version only for CPU processing or the full package with support for GPU processing.

### Command-line interface

DreamPower can be used from any terminal, a wide variety of arguments are offered to configure it.

By being a CLI it is possible to use it to create other projects ranging from cloud services to graphical interfaces like **DreamTime**.

### NVIDIA GPU Support

While DeepNude is slow for just supporting CPU, DreamPower allows you to use the power of your NVIDIA GPU to nudify photos in seconds.

### Multithreading

DreamPower uses multiple cores of your CPU to speed up the process.

### Automatic Rescale

You can use automatic scaling methods to skip the use of croppers or editing programs, you will have a fake nude with a single command.

### GIF Support

DreamPower extracts each frame from a GIF, nudified it and puts it back together, all automatically.

### Video Support

Like .gifs, DreamPower is capable of nudify each frame of a video and putting it back together. Supports a variety of formats thanks to ffmpeg.

### Body Customization

Customize the body of your dream, you can create unique fake nudes as you like.

### Daemon

Leave the program running in the background while transforming all the photos in a folder in real time, just add photos to the folder and they will be nudified one by one.

### Original Dimensions

Using the scale method `Overlay` you can make the algorithm leave the original dimensions of the photo.

### Custom Masks

The advanced mode also known as "Custom masks" allows you to view and edit each step (mask) performed by the algorithm for the nudification, with some time and practice you can create custom masks that give better results than the automatic algorithm process.

### Active Development

DreamPower is open-source and gets occasional updates as well as community contributions.
